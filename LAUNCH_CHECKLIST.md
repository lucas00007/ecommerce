## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - MUST DO BEFORE LAUNCH

### 1. Payment Processing (URGENT!)

Your checkout currently collects credit card information but **DOES NOT PROCESS PAYMENTS**.

**What you need:**
- Set up a payment processor (Stripe, PayPal, or Square)
- Integrate payment API into CheckoutModal.jsx
- **NEVER store credit card numbers** - use payment processor's secure API

**Recommended:** Stripe (easiest to integrate)
- Sign up at https://stripe.com
- Get API keys
- Install: `npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js`

**DANGER:** Do not accept real orders until payment processing is working!

### 2. Custom Domain
**Current URL:** https://main.d1u6qbz2fcb47h.amplifyapp.com
