# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Launch Your Store

## Current Status: 🟡 ALMOST READY

Your website is deployed but needs 2 critical things before accepting real customers:

1. ✅ **Legal Policies** - DONE! (Terms, Privacy, Returns)
2. ⚠️ **Payment Processing** - NEEDS SETUP
3. ⚠️ **Custom Domain** - RECOMMENDED

---

## 🎯 Priority Action Items

### 1. SET UP STRIPE PAYMENTS (1-2 hours)

**Why:** Your checkout collects credit cards but doesn't process them!

**Steps:**
1. Read `STRIPE_SETUP.md` (detailed guide)
2. Create Stripe account: https://stripe.com
3. Get API keys from dashboard
4. Add keys to `.env` file
5. Set up backend (Lambda or Express)
6. Test with test cards

**Cost:** 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (no monthly fee)

---

### 2. GET CUSTOM DOMAIN (30 minutes)

**Why:** `d1u6qbz2fcb47h.amplifyapp.com` looks unprofessional

**Steps:**
1. Read `DOMAIN_SETUP.md` (detailed guide)
2. Go to AWS Route 53
3. Search for domain (e.g., southerndesignsstore.com)
4. Purchase domain ($12-15/year)
5. Connect to Amplify (automatic)
6. Wait 1 hour for DNS/SSL

**Recommended domains:**
- southerndesignsstore.com
- southerndesigns.shop
- andeanalpacastore.com
